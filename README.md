# US-Oil-Production-Data-Cleaning-Project
This data set, “Weekly_US_Crude_Oil.csv”, contains the weekly U.S. field production of crude oil in Thousand Barrels per day. The data is from the first week of 1983 to the second week of February 2021. The code I have written cleans this data to create time series line plots and perform a trend analysis.
